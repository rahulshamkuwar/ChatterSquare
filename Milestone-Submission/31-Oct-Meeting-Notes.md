# October 31, 2022 TA Meeting Notes

## Basic Overview of Project
Our project is a messaging website/app. The concept is based around the term "chatterbox" where it is for people who like to talk/message a lot. The more you message, the more points you can earn to unlock special features or perks.

## Progress since last meeting

## Plans for the remainder of the week
- finishing the wireframe (on Figma) in order to fully map out what else needs to be included on to-do list
- coordinate in order to distribute workload and to-do process
- start on front-end
- start on back-end (we will be using socket.io for out live-chat feature)

## Other details to consider
- for those who are not familiar with socket.io, it is recommended to do some reasearch on it before we fully begin working with it
- the location of the point system/counter/store still needs to be decided (whether it will be its own page or included in profile)
